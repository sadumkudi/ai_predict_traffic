# Traffic Prediction

This project implements a traffic prediction model using a neural network, model developed using MLPRegressor. This project aims to predict traffic patterns based on various input features, leveraging machine learning techniques for accurate predictions.


## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.x (preferably the latest stable version)

Git for version control

## Installation
1.   Clone the repository:


    Open a terminal and run:   
    git clone https://github.com/sadumkudi/ai_predict_traffic.git
    cd ai_predict_traffic
2.   Create a Python virtual environment:
   
    python -m venv myvenv

3.   Activate the virtual environment:

    On Windows:    
    myvenv\Scripts\activate

    On Linux/macOS:    
    source myvenv/bin/activate

4.   Install the required dependencies:
   
    Run the following command to install the necessary Python modules:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the Application
Once the environment is set up and the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the application:

    python app.py
